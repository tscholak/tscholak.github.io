        <h2>Trouble in LA LA Land: Did MiniMax Just Kill Efficient Attention?</h2>
        <p></p>
        <p><p>When you're building efficient LLMs and a major industrial lab says
"we tried this path, it doesn't work at scale," your first instinct is
to listen (and cry). Maybe your assumptions are wrong. Maybe you're
about to waste a lot of compute chasing a dead end. That's where I was
this week.</p></p>

        <h2>Skills, Composition, and the Coordination Problem</h2>
        <p></p>
        <p><p>Anthropic released <a
href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/skills">Skills</a> last week, and
the response was immediate: finally, composable AI capabilities! Build
once, reuse anywhere. Give Claude folders of instructions and scripts,
and it'll load what it needs automatically. Modular, portable,
efficient. We'll have reliable AI systems using hundreds or thousands or
hundreds of thousands of skills in no time. There's just one problem:
Skills aren't actually composable, and that creates a coordination
problem that needs to be addressed urgently.</p></p>

        <p></p>
        <p><p>NVIDIA's DGX Spark promises to put an "AI supercomputer" on your
desk. But for most people, owning a $4,000 box is slower, less flexible,
and more expensive than renting smartly. Here's why.</p></p>

this week</a>, a platform with a visual workflow editor, versioned
agents, governed connectors, and evals infrastructure. The internet
immediately split into two camps: people dunking on it ("this isn't
AGI!") and people defending visual editors as necessary for
non-technical users. Both camps are arguing about the wrong thing.</p></p>

        <h2>Stop Renting Moat: Why Enterprises Must Own Part of Their AI Stack</h2>
        <p></p>
        <p><p>Enterprises are told they have to choose between cost or
differentiation. But that's a false choice. If you outsource all AI,
your costs stay volatile and your upside is capped. The winners will own
enough of the stack to control both unit cost and quality.</p></p>

        <h2>How to Get from A Tree to A Flat Shape And Back Again</h2>
        <p></p>
        <p><p>The adventure continues in this "Unrecurse" sequel. Previously, we
bravely faced turmoil and confusion in a cruel world in which Haskell
suddenly stopped supporting recursive function calls. We barely escaped
the wrath of the compiler. This time, we try to survive an even more
extreme situation: Haskell without recursive data types! It is the
ultimate test of our programming skills. Will we make it through the
final challenge, or is all hope lost? Join us in this journey about
tapes and tribulations.</p></p>

        <h2>Unrecurse -- A Recursive Function That Doesn&#39;t Recurse</h2>
        <p></p>
        <p><p>Have you ever wanted to write a recursive function and wondered what
would happen if someone took away recursion from Haskell? Say goodbye to
recursive function calls, say goodbye to recursive data types. How sad
Haskell would be without them! I'm sure that thought must have occured
to you -- if not, what are you even doing here?! Well, this article has
you covered should that day ever come. After reading it, you will know
how to write a recursive function that doesn't recurse.</p></p>
