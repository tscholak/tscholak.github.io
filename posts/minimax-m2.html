        <p>When you're building efficient LLMs and a major industrial lab says
"we tried this path, it doesn't work at scale," your first instinct is
to listen (and cry). Maybe your assumptions are wrong. Maybe you're
about to waste a lot of compute chasing a dead end. That's where I was
this week.</p>
        <p>My team is betting big on hybrid architectures: mixing full and
efficient attention (SWA/sparse, linear/SSM, etc.) with learned layer
placement. Then MiniMax dropped their <a
href="https://www.zhihu.com/question/1965302088260104295/answer/1966810157473335067">M2
post-mortem bomb</a> on October 25th explaining to everyone why they
went back to quadratic attention for their 230B model. By October 29th,
<a href="https://x.com/giffmana/status/1983457240452673710">the</a> <a
href="https://x.com/zpysky1125/status/1983383094607347992">internet</a>
<a href="https://x.com/p_nawrot/status/1983579777844834459">was</a> <a
href="https://x.com/DBahdanau/status/1983909078414831987">convinced</a>:
efficient attention is dead. We told you so.</p>
<p>Except that's not what MiniMax said. The more I looked into their
reasoning, the more I realized their decision actually strengthens the
case for efficient hybrids in ways nobody's talking about.</p>
<h2 id="what-minimax-actually-said">What MiniMax Actually Said</h2>
<p>If you read MiniMax's post-mortem carefully, their conclusion is
actually nuanced. They didn't say efficient attention is fundamentally
broken. Their exact words: "一直在做，但是在工业系统里真的打过Full
Attention还有些距离" (We've always been working on it, but truly beating
full attention (FA) in industrial systems still has some way to go). In
other words, efficient attention lacks production readiness at their
scale with today's infrastructure. So it's a question of not if, but
when.</p>
<p>And yeah, I get it. Anyone who's tried to run linear attention in
production knows the pain. I can personally attest to this, because we
did it in our <a
href="https://github.com/ServiceNow/Fast-LLM">Fast-LLM</a> training
framework this year. Build failures from <code>mamba-ssm</code> or FLA
with cryptic CUDA linker errors. An afternoon hunting for the magic
combination of torch version, CUDA toolkit, and kernel implementation
that doesn't segfault. Getting TP to work wasn't straightforward either.
Then the serving stack surprises you by missing chunked prefill,
speculative decoding, or prefix caching. On that note, prefix caching is
the reason why efficient attention often fails to deliver in practice:
once your serving stack caches the prefix, the memory and compute
savings compared to FA vanish. And that's exactly where most production
traffic lives.</p>
<p>Also, FA just works. The kernel ecosystem is mature, and the whole
ecosystem is built around its assumptions. It's still getting better all
the time. For a 230B production model serving millions of users, you
really can't mess around.</p>
<p>Then there's model quality. Their <a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08313">Lightning Attention hybrid</a>
crushed the standard benchmarks everybody uses for pretraining ablations
that work without much post-training. Your usual suspects, MMLU, BBH,
LongBench, etc. But when they scaled to large-scale, multi-hop reasoning
and agent tasks with genuinely long contexts, big cracks appeared. After
their pretrained FA model was converted to Lightning Attention hybrids,
performance on these tasks dropped significantly. They attributed this
to the hybrid's inability to maintain the complex attention patterns
that the model had developed during pretraining. These are retrieval
heads, induction heads, and long-range coherence mechanisms that become
structurally essential. They tried detecting critical heads and keeping
only those as FA, but they weren't able to reliably identify and retain
all the patterns.</p>
<p>In the end, they chose certainty over risk. For their timeline and
scale, that was the right call.</p>
<p>But while MiniMax was wrestling with efficient attention, a different
line of research was quietly changing the landscape.</p>
<h2 id="the-delethink-twist">The Delethink Twist</h2>
<p>The recent <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06557">Markovian
Thinker</a> work shows something that will send shockwaves through the
efficient attention debate: reasoning is naturally Markovian. Put
simply, when models think step by step, they rarely need to remember the
entire chain of thought. What matters is the most recent slice, the
current working memory.</p>
<p>Delethink from the paper is a technique that exploits this. The idea:
Train a model to reason in 8K-token chunks. Then, at the chunk boundary,
delete the first part of the reasoning chain, keep only the last portion
as carryover state, and continue. Sounds weird and counterintuitive, but
this works reasonably well already for large off-the-shelf models, i.e.
unmodified gpt-oss. Through RL even 1.5B parameter models can learn to
work under the Delethink Markovian constraint. They showed that such a
Delethink-enabled model can think in 8K chunks and match standard
LongCoT-RL performance trained with full 24K context.</p>
<p>I will spell this out for you: <strong>Delethink lets you run FA
models with effectively linear memory and compute for reasoning
tasks.</strong> You chunk the reasoning chain, delete the old parts, and
only keep the recent context. This quietly changes the story for FA. If
you're running a thinking process that generates 50K tokens, FA with
Delethink gives you O(1) memory and O(n) compute. The quadratic blowup
disappears. With this, suddenly we have a credible way to stay on plain
FA, handle longer chains, lower memory, and stick with infrastructure
that already works. The pressure to migrate away from FA drops
significantly.</p>
<p>So MiniMax's decision makes sense for single-shot reasoning. They
(and everyone else) can run FA with Delethink, avoid the engineering
pain of efficient attention, and sidestep the quality risks of hybrids.
But what about M2's actual workload? Does M2 do single-shot
reasoning?</p>
<h2 id="the-m2-problem">The M2 Problem</h2>
<p>No, it doesn't. M2 follows the standard <a
href="https://huggingface.co/blog/MiniMax-AI/aligning-to-what#the-need-for-interleaved-thinking">interleaved-thinking
pattern</a>: it emits <code>&lt;think&gt;...&lt;/think&gt;</code>
blocks, and these blocks accumulate over multi-turn conversations. Every
bit of thinking history needs to be retained, and the <a
href="https://huggingface.co/MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-M2#inference-parameters">README</a>
warns that removing them hurts performance. Thus every exchange adds
more tokens, building up tens of thousands of reasoning tokens that must
stay in memory.</p>
<p>Delethink can't help here because it only works for single reasoning
chains, where you can truncate and carry forward a small state. But in
multi-turn conversations, the thinking tokens from previous turns belong
to conversation history. You can't delete all of them without negatively
impacting performance.</p>
<p>That means the computational blow-up returns. The longer a dialogue
continues, the heavier each turn becomes. MiniMax chose FA while
adopting the interleaved-thinking pattern that makes quadratic scaling
still painful. Every multi-turn conversation pays that quadratic tax
again and again.</p>
<p>So is efficient attention back in the game?</p>
<h2 id="what-jet-nemotron-shows">What Jet Nemotron Shows</h2>
<p>MiniMax's complaint was that you can't manually identify which
attention heads need to be FA. True enough. But <a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15884">NVIDIA's Jet Nemotron</a> work
shows you can <strong>learn</strong> the placement.</p>
<p>They built a supernet where each attention block can swap between FA,
SWA, and other efficient alternatives. During training, NVIDIA randomly
switched between options at each layer so all paths get gradient signal.
Hence the "supernet." Afterward, a lightweight search finds the optimal
layer configuration under a compute budget.</p>
<p>For a 4B-parameter 36-layer model and a budget of 3 FA, 7 SWA, and 26
linear layers, that's about 30.5 billion possible architectures in the
search space. But hierarchical beam search finds a top architecture
efficiently. After optimizing the linear attention for the chosen layers
further, they get their Jet-Nemotron-4B that beats Qwen3-1.7B on
standard benchmarks (including reasoning-heavy math tasks) while
delivering a massive 21x speedup at 64k tokens decoding length. The
smaller Jet-Nemotron-2B is slightly behind Qwen3-1.7B but delivers 47x
generation throughput speedup at 64k tokens and still 23x speedup at 8k
tokens. Prefill speedups are more modest, around 2.5x at 64k and 6x at
256k tokens, but still significant.</p>
<p>This is a big deal, and I think MiniMax missed it. The gains from Jet
Nemotron's learned placement are huge, and while the potential only
fully shows with large prefill and long decode (because that's where FA
is memory-bound), the impact is clear, because that's also the regime
interleaved thinking with its accumulated context operates in.</p>
<p>But Jet Nemotron proved this only at 2-4B scale. M2 is 230B
parameters, 57 times larger. Nobody has published results at that scale.
We don't know if you still only need 3 FA layers at 230B scale, or if
you need 10 or 20. We don't know what the compute budget looks like for
training the supernet at the big scale. Until that evidence extends
upward, FA remains the safe bet for massive models.</p>
<h2 id="the-nuanced-story">The Nuanced Story</h2>
<p>So, where does that leave us? It's clear that we can't just proclaim
that linear attention blows FA out of the water anymore. I won't be able
to argue that point convincingly anymore. The story now depends very
much on workload and scale.</p>
<p>For single-shot reasoning, FA plus Delethink is pragmatic. Stable
infrastructure, and the Markovian behavior is already there in
pretrained models. That buys time for the efficient attention ecosystem
to mature. At M2's scale, the infrastructure pain and model quality
risks of hybrids outweigh the compute savings and speed benefits of
efficient attention. FA with Delethink is the right call for the
majority of single-shot reasoning workloads right now.</p>
<p>For multi-turn interleaved thinking, hybrids with learned placement
will eventually become essential. Context accumulates, Delethink can't
reset it, and FA's quadratic cost will dominate. Optimized hybrids will
win that regime, and that's where the field is heading. That's where my
team is heading. See you in the efficient-attention trenches.</p>

<p><strong>Update Oct 31, 2025:</strong> The day after I posted this, <a
href="https://huggingface.co/moonshotai/Kimi-Linear-48B-A3B-Instruct">Kimi.ai
released</a> <a
href="https://github.com/fla-org/flash-linear-attention/tree/main/fla/ops/kda">Kimi
Linear Attention (KLA)</a>, a new hybrid architecture that validates the
core argument here in ways even I didn't expect, at least not so
soon.</p>
<p>KLA extends Gated DeltaNet with channel-wise gating (instead of
scalar gating) and interleaves this efficient attention with full
attention in a 3:1 ratio. That ratio matters: just like Jet Nemotron
found that only 2-3 layers out of 36 need FA, Kimi found that roughly
25% FA is enough to maintain quality while cutting KV cache by 75% and
delivering 6x decoding throughput at 1M context.</p>
<p>The results are great. On synthetic tasks like MQAR and Stack, KLA
significantly outperforms Mamba2 and beats Gated DeltaNet. On real
reasoning tasks (AIME 2025, MATH500, LiveCodeBench), it matches or beats
both MLA (DeepSeek's compressed full attention) and Gated DeltaNet-H
after the same SFT recipe. Pretraining scaling laws show 1.16x better
loss at the same compute budget.</p>
<p>Two caveats: First, this is a 3B-activated, 48B-total parameter
model. M2 is 230B total, so roughly 5x larger. We still don't know what
happens at that scale, but the trend is promising. Second, Kimi uses a
fixed 3:1 ratio rather than learned placement, so we don't know if
that's optimal or just good enough.</p>
<p>But here's what matters: within days of MiniMax saying "efficient
attention has some way to go," another major industrial lab shipped a
production-grade hybrid that beats full attention on the metrics that
matter.</p>
<p>The confusion MiniMax's post-mortem created also triggered a flurry
of activity. Everyone working on efficient attention saw an opening and
pushed out their work. <a
href="https://manifestai.com/articles/release-brumby-14b/">Brumby-14B</a>
(an attention-free model converted from Qwen), <a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04239">Higher-order Linear
Attention</a>, and several others all dropped within days. The Flash
Linear Attention community <a
href="https://github.com/fla-org/flash-linear-attention/pull/621">merged
Kimi's optimized KDA kernel</a> within hours. There's now active debate
about which approach wins where.</p>
<p>What looked like a setback for efficient attention turned into its
Streisand moment. MiniMax forced everyone to clarify their positions,
tighten their arguments, and ship their code. The infrastructure is
maturing faster than anyone expected. The timeline just got a lot
shorter.</p>
