        <p>OpenAI <a
href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-agentkit/">shipped AgentKit
this week</a>, a platform with a visual workflow editor, versioned
agents, governed connectors, and evals infrastructure. The internet
immediately split into two camps: people dunking on it ("this isn't
AGI!") and people defending visual editors as necessary for
non-technical users. Both camps are arguing about the wrong thing.</p>
        <p>Harrison Chase from LangChain wrote <a
href="https://blog.langchain.com/not-another-workflow-builder/">a
thoughtful piece called "Not Another Workflow Builder,"</a> arguing that
visual workflow builders are getting squeezed from both directions:
simple agents (prompt &amp; tools) are handling low-complexity tasks,
while code-based workflows (like LangGraph) win at high complexity. His
conclusion: the middle ground is dying, focus on better no-code agents
and better code generation instead.</p>
<p>It's a clean thesis. Unfortunately, it's also missing the forest for
the trees.</p>
<h2 id="the-abstraction-confusion">The Abstraction Confusion</h2>
<p>Here's what's actually happening: we are watching three different
communities argue past each other because they are each solving for
different constraints.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The "simple agents win" crowd sees frontier models getting better
and concludes that explicit orchestration becomes unnecessary. Just
throw GPT-5 at the problem with some tools and let emergence handle the
rest. They are right that many workflows are just prompt engineering in
disguise. They look at complex systems and see overengineering.</p></li>
<li><p>The "visual workflow necessary" crowd needs to ship products with
non-technical stakeholders, wants observability baked in, and needs
governance that works at the organizational level. They are right that
code doesn't easily surface what's running and why. They look at
code-first approaches and see gatekeeping.</p></li>
<li><p>The "visual workflow bad" crowd wants composability, types, and
the ability to reason about systems explicitly and even formally. They
are right that dragging boxes around in a canvas doesn't give us
algebraic properties or type safety. They look at AgentKit's visual
editor and see toy-like systems that won't scale.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All three are correct about what they're optimizing for. All three
are wrong about what the actual problem is.</p>
<h2 id="what-agentkit-actually-represents">What AgentKit Actually
Represents</h2>
<p>Strip away the visual editor for a moment. What did OpenAI actually
release?</p>
<p>They released a platform for building, deploying, and iterating on
multi-agent systems with the following key primitives: versioned
workflows, a governed connector registry (where admins manage how data
and tools connect), guardrails, evaluation infrastructure, and
reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) integration. The visual canvas is
actually the least interesting part of the release.</p>
<p>OpenAI understands that the real problem isn't how users specify what
they want (visual vs code vs natural language), but how we build systems
that compose, verify, observe, and improve.</p>
<p>Harrison's squeeze thesis argues that visual workflow builders are
losing from both ends. But this assumes the primary value of visual
builders is specification, i.e. helping people define workflows. That's
not actually their killer feature. When done right, visual builders are
primarily about operational visibility. They make implicit logic
explicit, they create artifacts that stakeholders can review, they
enable governance at the right granularity, and they provide
observability by default. These are organizational problems, not
individual productivity problems.</p>
<p>I don't see AgentKit's pitch as "drag boxes instead of writing code."
I see it as "version your agents, govern your data connectors, evaluate
systematically, and iterate with RFT." The visual editor is merely how
OpenAI is packaging that infrastructure for adoption.</p>
<h2 id="the-compositional-substrate-nobodys-building">The Compositional
Substrate Nobody's Building</h2>
<p>Here's my contrarian take: both visual builders and natural language
prompts are failing at scale for the same reason, and it has nothing to
do with their interface paradigm.</p>
<p>I had a long conversation with <a
href="https://pchiusano.github.io">Paul Chiusano</a> from Unison
Computing about this last week. Paul is a functional programming
language designer and a big advocate for types and formal methods. He
says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I am pretty uninterested in all these WYSIWYG type workflow engines,
even with some AI sauce sprinkled on top. I want types and higher-order
functions and all the niceties of a modern programming language."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is he a snob for wanting that? No. He's pointing at tools for
managing complexity with a proven track record. Type systems catch
errors before runtime. Higher-order abstractions let programmers build
big things from small things with clear interfaces. Referential
transparency lets people reason locally about global properties.</p>
<p>Neither visual workflow builders nor natural language prompts provide
these properties. They both scale terribly once a certain complexity
threshold is crossed, for the same underlying reason: they don't provide
compositional guarantees.</p>
<p>A visual workflow with 50 nodes and complex branching is
unmaintainable not because it's visual, but because the edges between
nodes carry no semantic contracts. You can't compose workflows safely
because there's no type system preventing you from wiring incompatible
things together. You can't refactor with confidence because there's no
way to verify that your changes preserve behavior.</p>
<p>Similarly, a complex prompt-based agent scales poorly not because
natural language is inherently bad, but because prompts have no formal
composition semantics. You can't build a library of reusable "prompt
modules" with clear interfaces. You can't verify that chaining two
prompts preserves invariants. You can't reason about what happens when
an agent calls a tool that calls another agent.</p>
<p>The problem is not the interface. It's that neither provides
compositional abstractions with formal semantics.</p>
<h2 id="what-code-actually-gives-you">What Code Actually Gives You</h2>
<p>Harrison is right that code wins at the high-complexity end. But it's
worth being precise about why.</p>
<p>Code doesn't win because developers are special or because typing
text is inherently better than dragging boxes. It wins because it's the
only common representation that provides formal semantics we can reason
about, composability through functions and types, verification via type
checkers and tests, versioning and diffing as first-class operations,
and -- critically -- an artifact that is the ground truth of
execution.</p>
<p>This last point is often missed: even if AI always generates perfect
code from natural language descriptions, you still need the code because
the code is the specification of what you actually built and run.
Natural language is for intent, code is for commitment. It's like the
difference between a contract and a conversation. You need both. They
are complementary.</p>
<h2 id="stop-arguing-about-interfaces">Stop Arguing About
Interfaces</h2>
<p>We need to stop conflating the construction interface with the
operational model. The answer isn't choosing between visual, code, or
natural language. We need all three serving different purposes:</p>
<p><strong>Natural language</strong> for expressing human intent and
constraints. <strong>Formal contracts</strong> (types, schemas,
invariants) that specify interfaces and composition rules.
<strong>Code</strong> that implements logic within those contracts,
whether written by humans or generated by AI. <strong>Observability
infrastructure</strong> (traces, evals, guardrails) that shows what
actually happened and feeds back into intent and contracts.</p>
<p>Visual builders try to be all of these simultaneously. That's why
they break. Natural language prompts pretend formal contracts don't
exist. That's why they don't compose. Code-first approaches often skip
observability or treat intent as separate from the system. That's why
they struggle with alignment.</p>
<p>AgentKit is interesting because it's actually trying to build
multiple layers: typed connectors, visual composition as an interface to
implementation, execution with guardrails, and evals infrastructure.
Whether their specific implementation works is TBD, but the architecture
is pointing in the right direction.</p>
<h2 id="what-happens-if-we-get-this-wrong">What Happens If We Get This
Wrong</h2>
<p>Here's what's at stake: we're about to build multi-agent systems that
make consequential decisions at scale. Process invoices. Route customer
support. Manage infrastructure. Screen resumes. Handle medical
triage.</p>
<p>If we build these systems without compositional guarantees, we get
brittle towers of duct tape that work until they catastrophically don't.
If we build them without observability, we get black boxes that fail in
inexplicable ways. If we build them without formal contracts, we can't
verify they preserve the properties we care about. And if we skip the
natural language layer, we've built something only five people in the
world can understand and maintain.</p>
<p>The teams currently arguing about visual vs code vs prompts are
missing the point. The only important question is: can we build systems
that are simultaneously verifiable (formal contracts), understandable
(operational visibility), and accessible (natural language intent)?</p>
<p>I believe the answer is yes, but only if we stop arguing about
interfaces and start building the compositional substrate underneath. We
need strong types and formal semantics, visual projection for operations
and governance, natural language for intent and constraints, and
continuous eval for alignment.</p>
<p>The team that figures out how to integrate all of these coherently
will win.</p>
<p>I'm watching closely.</p>
